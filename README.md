# Next.js 15 Runtime Error on Vercel Deployment

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered when deploying a Next.js 15 application to Vercel. The error occurs on a seemingly harmless line of code within a component. The issue is specific to the Vercel deployment environment and does not reproduce locally.

## Problem

A Next.js 15 app is built and runs correctly locally, but it throws a runtime error when deployed to Vercel. The error message is not very specific, making it difficult to diagnose the root cause. The problematic line of code is highlighted in the `about.js` file. The error only occurs in the production environment, not during development.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying a potential conflict or unexpected behavior in the Vercel build process. In this case, adding a console log statement before the problematic line (or making sure that all the imports are correct and are called properly) helped debug the error.  In some cases, it might require changes to the `next.config.js` file or additional configurations to properly resolve the conflict. The solution is provided in `aboutSolution.js`

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the application.
4. Deploy the application to Vercel. You will observe the error.  The error might need several attempts to reproduce.
5. Replace the content in `pages/about.js` with the one in `aboutSolution.js` and deploy again to observe that the error is resolved.
